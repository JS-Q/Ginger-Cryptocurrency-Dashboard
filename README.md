**Working of Ginger**

→ The browser sends a request for cryptocurrency dashboard to be displayed. <br>
→ The backend (node.js) fetches the cryptocurrency information through Coingecko API. <br>
→ A JSON response is sent back to the backend. (node.js) <br>
→ Finally, a HTML page is rendered on the browser. <br>
